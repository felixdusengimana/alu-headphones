# ALU Headphones
* This web page was coded from scratch based on some design models given on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/xxe8H7uIC9vnoEzGmFU0td/Holberton-School---Headphone-company--Copy-?node-id=0-1&t=s5K4UIH0O2o7b0i2-1)

* The designs were planned for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile, so the web page was implemented with responsiveness to different device sizes.

## Accessibility
* Besides the responsiveness of the site, the web page was also coded to be as accessible as possible.

* All aria labels and content presentation considerations were taken into account in the HTML layout.

* The site was developed with semantic HTML, which helps screen readers and other assistive technologies to interpret the content correctly.
